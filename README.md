# SIEM-Detection-Lab

## Objective

The SIEM Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

. Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
. Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
. Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
. Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
. Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
Network analysis tools (Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
Telemetry generation tools (Zenmap) to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.

### Steps

Create Azure Subscription
Create VMs
Create Resource group 
Create log Analytics (to ingest the logs)
Connect VMs to newly created log Analytics
