# SIEM-Detection-Lab

## Objective

The SIEM Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

<ul>
  <li>Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application</li>
  <li> Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs</li>
  <li>Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns</li>
<li>Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilitie</li>
<li>Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity</li>
</ul>

### Tools Used

<ul>
  <li>Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis</li>
  <li>Network analysis tools (Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic</li>
  <li>Telemetry generation tools (Zenmap - Nping) to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios</li>
</ul>


### Steps

<ul>
 <li>Create Azure Subscription</li>
 <li>Create VMs</li>
 <li>Create Resource group </li>
 <li> Create log Analytics (to ingest the logs)</li>
 <li>Connect VMs to newly created log Analytics</li>
</ul>
